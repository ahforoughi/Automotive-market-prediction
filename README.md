# Automotive-market-prediction
An ML-based model to predict the market of Automotive. It will serve as the flask web server. This demonstrates how to serve ML models as APIs in microservices. 

## requirements
You can install requirements of this project by:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

 
## How to run
you can run this by:
```
flask run
```
you can find data exploration and model training on the `data-model.ipynb` file. The flask webserver will load the trained model created in this notebook.
you can access this via `localhost:5000`.
